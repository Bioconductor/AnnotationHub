This document needs to outline a roadmap for the future of
AnnotationHub and AnnotationHubServer.  Specifically: What resources
should be included?  What is the expected time when those resources
should be made available?  And how should we justify the inclusion of
some resources and not others?  

Before adressing the 1st two questions, lets consider the last one.
What considerations should be given to a resource to merit it's
inclusion?  A big part of this is how can we discriminate annotations
from mere data sets?  For while many annotations may start as data
sets, not all data sets eventually become annotations.


1) The annotations should be widely used.

2) The annotations should come from respectable sources.

3) The annotations should be considered valuable by the community.

4) The annotations should have input from multiple different resources.





What resources should be included?

#############
## Huge resources from national centers:

* NCBI: (gene stuff is well supported already, but MANY other kinds of data are not)

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/all/#downloads_

For other data: possibility of communicating with Eric Sayers Ph.D. to see about
modernizing e-utils?  Does Sean know him?
(OR we can just raid their FTP sites as usual)


For existing annots: should just make our packages available on AnnotationHub.

Unsupported Annotations:
1000 Genomes (in progress)
ENCODE (in progress?)
ATCC
CDD
dbVar, dbGaP, dbSNP
PopSet, HomoloGene, Protein clusters
OMIM, OMIA
Taxonomy 
(and more)


* ensembl:
 (FTP files are in progress.  Most gene oriented stuff is already in biomaRt)
http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html





#############
## Very popular specialized community resources (most of these would be covered if we just make packages available).

* UCSC: Contains many tracks that we should probably expose (as GRanges)

* KEGG: Available again as KEGGREST
  
* Reactome: Available as a Database object (but much room for improvement)

* GO: Available as a Database object

* Uniprot: Available as a web service





#############
## Support for more specialized centers?:

* Tair: Available as a OrgDb object

* SGD: Available as a OrgDb object

* Blast2Go: Available as a mappings only (should probably be expanded)

* Allen Brain data: Could make a web service (they claim a restful interface)

* PlasmoDB:  Partially available as a OrgDb object.

* PANTHER:  Might be made available by volunteer?
